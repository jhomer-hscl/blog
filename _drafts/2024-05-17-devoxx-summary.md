## Other Talks

Most talks are available on YouTube [2024 Devoxx UK](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKuh52zVrL6lI2yr3bDE16g_6ur4Z6cPf) as are previous years.

There are a number that I'll try to catch up on as I either heard good things or there were clashes. In particular:

* [97 Things Every Java Programmer Should Know](https://youtu.be/td-3t3TBk1I?feature=shared)
* [How We Decide](https://youtu.be/qvV8GnIf974?feature=shared)

It doesn't look like the mini labs were recorded but I heard good things about "Talk Nerdy To Me - Creating Effective Technical Presentation (Mey Beisaron)".

## Summary

Really enjoyed it, was good to be out of the office.

Not vendor specific or pushing £££ solutions.

Easy going, relaxed, would recommend and will likely attend again in the future.
