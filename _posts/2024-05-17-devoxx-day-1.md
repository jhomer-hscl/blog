Last week I had the pleasure of attending [Devoxx UK](https://www.devoxx.co.uk/) with colleagues from a client.

Here are notes, links, etc. to talks I attended on Day 1.

~~I'll link to the YouTube videos when available.~~

## Opening Keynote: Code Play Repeat: How to learn any Programming Language

Entertaining and engaging speaker. Yes, I learn stuff this way without even realising it.

## Securing the Supply Chain for Your Java Applications

Good talk introducing concepts of Supply Chain Security, [VEX](https://cyclonedx.org/capabilities/vex/) and [SBOM](https://cyclonedx.org/capabilities/sbom/).

There are two emerging standards [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/) and [SPDX](https://spdx.dev/), suggestion that the formers has more applications supporting it.

Some of the specifics:

* Signing of git commits - but there is plenty of debate about if this is a good thing to do.
* There is a Maven plugin for generating SBOM files.
* The order of repositories in Maven can be important.
* Native executable (with [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/)) reduced attack surface vs JAR.
* Cloud Native Buildpacks - remove the the need for Docker file, selecting/securing base images, etc.
* SBOM can be generated at build and then scan the file (not the JAR) later in the pipeline.
* SBOM can be scanned in the future to check against new vulnerabilities, no need to re-scan the JAR.
* Can load SBOMs into other applications to track, manage, etc.
* [OWASP Dependency Track](https://owasp.org/www-project-dependency-track/) for managing SBOMs. Open source project with helm charts.

[sigstore cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign):

* Use this for signing artefacts:
  * Binaries
  * Images
  * SBOMs

[SLSA](https://slsa.dev/) - **S**upply chain **L**evels for **S**oftware **A**rtifacts:

* Provides provenance
* Sign for verification

Then in the *deployment* pipeline:

* Verify signatures
* Verify provenance (SLSA)
* Verify vulnerability report
* ...

## Smooth Sailing in the Cloud-Native Storm: Tools for better confidence in microservices development

Testing against containerised apps. This is good to do at a service level.

TestContainers are something I already use to spin up Docker containers I am developing/testing. I know they can be used to spin up dependencies, e.g. redis, mongo, etc. But didn't realise each of these comes with a specific api.

Attention was drawn the second part of the talk on [Microcks](https://testcontainers.com/modules/microcks/) which feels like something I should look into as a possible replacement for other tools I use. Bring all test resources within `testcontainers`.

See also:

* [Open source cloud-native tool for API Mocking and Testing](https://microcks.io/)
* [microcks](https://github.com/microcks/microcks)

Other info:

* Testcontainers is now owned by Docker.
* There is a free [Testcontainers Desktop](https://testcontainers.com/desktop/) application.
* There is a paid for [Testcontainers Cloud](https://testcontainers.com/cloud/) service. Use cases:
  * Cannot install/run Docker locally
  * ...
* [Testcontainers Slack](https://slack.testcontainers.org/).

Ideas from this:

* Contribute with a NiFi test container.

## 11 Practices to improve your productivity and reduce your frustration with Kubernetes

* Using [Power tools for kubectl](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx).
* aliases, but it can get silly.
* waiting for conditions, e.g. deployment to be ready.
* Generating yaml manifests
* etc, etc, - see the slides and the talk...

Other:

* Demos also used [command-line fuzzy finder](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) which looked an interesting addition to my shell.
* Didn't cover [k9s](https://k9scli.io/) due to time but this was used as part of other demos. I'm currently using this and is well worth a look.

Link to [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OC4ln1TLNL0lgzFPLeggAc1CnhozjHGJZkW6oj1fFm8/mobilepresent)

Ideas / Things to try from this:

* Running `minikube` using `devcontainers`.
* Running multi-node cluster using `kind`.
* Using the power tools.

## DevSecOps in Action: Achieving Continuous Compliance with GitLab

Presented by [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) employee on GitLab functionality, so no surprises it was GitLab specific.

The functionality discussed was premium, i.e. Â£Â£Â£, but showed how GitLab can help with DevSecOps compliance and integrate tooling into the development process with the checks and balances part of the build pipelines.

## Continuous Profiling, the missing piece of your observability puzzle

Introduced me to the concept of profiling.

Tools:

* Python - [cProfile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html#)
* Kubernetes - [Pixie](https://docs.px.dev/)
* Java - [Pyrsocope](https://pyroscope.io/)
* [Parca](https://www.parca.dev/docs/overview)

Gotchas:

* Beware of the Java Safepoint Bias.
