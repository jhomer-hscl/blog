Last week I had the pleasure of attending [Devoxx UK](https://www.devoxx.co.uk/) with colleagues from a client.

Here are notes, links, etc. to talks I attended on Day 1.

~~I'll link to the YouTube videos when available.~~

### Opening Keynote: Joy and Innovation in Programming Through a Childlike Learning Approach

### Opening Keynote: Code Play Repeat: How to learn any Programming Language

Entertaining and engaging speaker. Yes, I learn stuff this way without even realising it.

### Smooth Sailing in the Cloud-Native Storm: Tools for better confidence in microservices development

Testing against containerised apps. This is good to do at a service level.

TestContainers are something I already use to spin up Docker containers I am developing/testing. I know they can be used to spin up dependencies, e.g. redis, mongo, etc. But didn't realise each of these comes with a specific api.

Attention was drawn the second part of the talk on [Microcks](https://testcontainers.com/modules/microcks/) which feels like something I should look into as a possible replacement for other tools I use. Bring all test resources within `testcontainers`.

See also:

* [Open source cloud-native tool for API Mocking and Testing](https://microcks.io/)
* [microcks](https://github.com/microcks/microcks)

Other info:

* Testcontainers is now owned by Docker.
* There is a free [Testcontainers Desktop](https://testcontainers.com/desktop/) application.
* There is a paid for [Testcontainers Cloud](https://testcontainers.com/cloud/) service. Use cases:
  * Cannot install/run Docker locally
  * ...
* [Testcontainers Slack](https://slack.testcontainers.org/).

Ideas from this:

* Contribute with with NiFi test container.

### 11 Practices to improve your productivity and reduce your frustration with Kubernetes

* Using [Power tools for kubectl](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx).
* aliases, but it can get silly.
* waiting for conditions, e.g. deployment to be ready.
* Generating yaml manifests
* etc, etc, - see the slides and the talk...

Other:

* Demos also used [command-line fuzzy finder](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) which looked an interesting addition to my shell.
* Didn't cover [k9s](https://k9scli.io/) due to time but this was used as part of other demos. I'm currently using this and is well worth a look.

Talk: TBD

Link to [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OC4ln1TLNL0lgzFPLeggAc1CnhozjHGJZkW6oj1fFm8/mobilepresent)

Ideas / Things to try from this:

* Running `minikube` using `devcontainers`.
* Running multi-node cluster using `kind`.
* Using the power tools.

### DevSecOps in Action: Achieving Continuous Compliance with GitLab

Presented by [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) employee on GitLab functionality, so no surprises it was GitLab specific.

Unfortunately the functionality discussed was premium, i.e. £££, but showed how GitLab can help with DevSecOps compliance and integrate tooling into the development process with the checks and balances part of the build pipelines.
