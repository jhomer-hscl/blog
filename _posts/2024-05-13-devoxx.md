Last week I had the pleasure of attending Devoxx UK with colleagues from a client.

Here are notes, links, etc. to talks I attended on Day 1.

I'll link to the YouTube videos when available.

## Opening Keynote: Joy and Innovation in Programming Through a Childlike Learning Approach

## Opening Keynote: Code Play Repeat: How to learn any Programming Language

## Opening Keynote: Fun for Now

## Securing the Supply Chain for Your Java Applications

## Smooth Sailing in the Cloud-Native Storm: Tools for better confidence in microservices development

Testing against containerised apps. This is good to do at a service level.

TestContainers are something I already use to spin up Docker containers I am developing/testing. I know they can be used to spin up dependencies, e.g. redis, mongo, etc. But didn;t realise each of these comes with a specific api.

Attention was drawn the second part of the talk on [Microcks](https://testcontainers.com/modules/microcks/) and [Open source cloud-native tool for API Mocking and Testing](https://microcks.io/) which feels like something I should look into as a possible replacement for other tools I use. Bring all test resources within `testcontainers`.

Other info:

* Testcontainers is now owned by Docker.
* There is a free [Testcontainers Desktop](https://testcontainers.com/desktop/) application.
* There is a paid for [Testcontainers Cloud](https://testcontainers.com/cloud/) service. Use cases:
  * Cannot install/run Docker locally
  * ...
* [Testcontainers Slack](https://slack.testcontainers.org/).

Talk: Link TBD.

Ideas from this:

* Contribute with with NiFi test container.
