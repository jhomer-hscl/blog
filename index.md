## Description

This is a based on steps from [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/skills/github-pages/tree/main).

I needed somewhere to publicly share some conference notes with colleagues, clients, etc. that didn't sit well with being in private area(s) that would probably have led to dupkication of content.

Sounded like an old school blog.

I can do better than and turn it into a learning exercise.
